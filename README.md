Hello, I am Brenda!! I am taking a career break to focus on skill development for a rewarding transition into the Tech industry. To achieve this, I am actively enrolled in the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Masterschool, the Full Stack Software Development program at Keyin College and E-C Council Cybersecurity C|CT.

With a robust professional background spanning 15+ years, I have gained valuable experience as a Business Development, Marketing, and Communications Specialist across diverse industries, including non-profit, government, healthcare, tourism, finance/real estate, and mining. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated strong leadership skills and excelled in strategic planning, brand development/management, and program/project management, ensuring exceptional customer satisfaction and engagement.
My passion lies in driving digital transformations that lead to revenue growth and operational success. As a seasoned E-Commerce and Digital Specialist, I thrive in multi-hat leadership roles, where I can inspire and guide teams towards achieving their full potential.

Beyond my professional achievements, I am deeply committed to fostering a people-first, safe workplace culture. I hold certifications in Employer Branding, Talent Acquisition, and Digital HR, and I am proud to be a certified Psychologically Safe Leader through UNB, as well as a certified Mental Health First Aider recognized by the Canadian Mental Health Association.

I am eager to leverage my experience, skills, and passion to make a significant impact in the tech industry, contributing to the advancement of secure and innovative data-driven landscapes. 

I anticipate completing DA at Masterschool in March 2024, and complete SD in December 2024. Security+ and C|CT exam preparation is in progress. I am open to remote freelance/contracts.
